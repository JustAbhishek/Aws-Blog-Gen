# Aws-Blog-Gen  
## Summary: "Implemented a scalable, serverless application to automate blog generation using Amazon Bedrock and AWS Lambda".  

## Key Features

- **Scalable Serverless Architecture** – Leverages AWS Lambda and Amazon Bedrock to automate blog generation efficiently.
- **Seamless API Integration** – Utilizes AWS API Gateway to handle incoming requests from Postman and route them to AWS Lambda.
- **Advanced AI-Powered Content Creation** – Employs the Llama 3 70B Instruct model for generating topic-specific blogs.
- **Secure & Reliable Storage** – Stores generated blogs in Amazon S3 with versioning enabled for data integrity.

## Technologies Used

- **Amazon Bedrock:** Provides foundation model access for AI-powered blog generation, enabling seamless content creation without managing infrastructure.
- **AWS Lambda:** Executes serverless functions to process blog generation requests dynamically, ensuring scalability and cost efficiency.
- **AWS API Gateway:** Acts as an entry point for handling HTTP requests from Postman, routing them to AWS Lambda for processing.
- **Llama 3 70B Instruct:** A large language model used for generating high-quality, topic-specific blogs with contextual relevance.
- **Amazon S3:** Stores generated blogs securely with versioning enabled, ensuring data integrity and easy retrieval.
- **Libraries:** boto3, json, datetime
- **Language:** Python

## Challenges and Learnings

### Challenges:  
- **Scalability & Performance Optimization** – Ensuring the serverless architecture efficiently handled concurrent blog generation requests without latency.  
- **Model Selection & Fine-Tuning** – Choosing the right AI model (Llama 3 70B Instruct) for generating high-quality, context-aware blogs while managing inference costs.  
- **API Request Handling** – Configuring AWS API Gateway to effectively route and process incoming POST requests from Postman with minimal delays.  
- **Data Storage & Integrity** – Implementing Amazon S3 versioning to prevent accidental overwrites and maintain historical blog records.  

### Learnings:
- **Efficient Serverless Design** – Optimized AWS Lambda execution by minimizing cold starts and managing memory allocation effectively.  
- **Model Performance Evaluation** – Understood how to balance cost, latency, and output quality when working with large AI models.  
- **API Security & Rate Limiting** – Gained insights into securing API endpoints using AWS IAM roles and API Gateway throttling mechanisms.  
- **Best Practices for S3 Storage** – Learned how to implement versioning, lifecycle policies, and access control for long-term data management.
